JMUJams
=======

- This project was created for a web application development class.
- The webserver we used is currently dormant, I'm working on switching servers.
- We worked in a team of 4 and used the MVC pattern for implementation.
- I created the CSS and most of the front-end (HTMLs and JSPs)
- After front-end was completed I worked with the team to finish the back-end (java beans and servlets)
- I would have preferred to implement JMUJams using a framework such as JSF or Struts 2.
